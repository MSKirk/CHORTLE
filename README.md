# CHORT
Coronal Hole Observer and Regional Tracker

## Overiew
Manifesting as regions of decreased emission in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and x-ray wavelengths, coronal holes are the observational signatures of open solar magnetic field. Coronal plasma within these regions is free to flow outward along open magnetic field lines, resulting in reduced density and emission. Studying these coronal hole regions provides useful insights into their connection with open magnetic field and the evolution of the solar cycle.

A previous incarnation of this code, GACHD ([Lowder et al 2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...783..142L), [Lowder et al 2017](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017SoPh..292...18L)), was developed and tested. This is a rewritten and revamped version of this code, written to utilize Python and SunPy.

## Goal
- Automated and adaptive coronal hole detection
- Input from multiple data sources, including SOHO/EIT, SDO/AIA, and STEREO/EUVI A&B
- Merging and bridging these datasets to cover solar cycles 23 and 24
- Tracking of coronal hole features to provide statistics on lifetimes and evolution
